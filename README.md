# Foundry Starter Template

A quick starter template with some additional setup I normally need.

## Features

### Foundry Configuration

- RPC Endpoints for Mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum; and their respective testnets.  
- Etherscan API Keys for Mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum; and their respective testnets.

#### Test configuration
- Default Verbosity set to `-vvv`
- Block timestamp set to `1681830000` instead of the unrealistic `1` default
- Increased amount of runs for **Fuzz and Invariant Tests** to 500. 

### Makefile

File with different `make` shortcuts for commonly used commands in Foundry.
